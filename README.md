# SSL-EAG-NeutronPy
Space Science Laboratory Experimental Astrophysics Group Neutron Imaging at UC Berkeley for Fall 2020 and Spring 2021 

## Project Overview
Element and/or isotope mapping is done using a neutron beam-line source and
neutron-counting microchannel plate detector with Timepix electronic readout. High-rate
simultaneous element-specific imaging creates a 10Gb data stream. Time at the testing site is
limited, with researchers often working around the clock to get their experiments done within a
reserved block of time. Given the time constraints, it's very useful to have a robust data
visualization software toolset so that the researcher can view data in near real-time to adjust
test parameters and optimize on the fly. The current project is a development effort for just such
a tool set. In addition, it is envisioned the toolset could be utilized from home or office. This is called NeutronPy
